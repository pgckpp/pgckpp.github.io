                    In the current coronavirus pandemic, we are experiencing a time suitable for deeper reflection on
                    life and the world. In this particular situation, I finally started a project I had been thinking
                    about recently. It compiles notes and sketches to write a book about our shared experiences over the
                    last few years, which we have had during the geomantic landscape study of the city of Český Krumlov
                    and its surroundings. During these years of work we managed to find the keys and inspiring elements
                    that guided the founders of the urbanistic concept of this wonderful city and great castle.In the
