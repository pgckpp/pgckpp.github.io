        <h1 id="uvod">CONCLUSION</h1>
        <p>
            After completing the work on all the stories of Český Krumlov, but especially after the study and conclusions on the history of the monasteries, I came to the idea that similar stories should also apply to religious buildings in general. The methodology for uncovering the geomantic foundations, that is, the spiritual power and energetic properties of the given place, must have preceded the idea and decision to build prehistoric sanctuaries and medieval churches. The finding of specific sites for the selection of a particular settlement was certainly determined by a noticeable spiritual energy quality of the respective site. What method they used back then is not known today. But we demonstrated that they were capable of doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trying to prove the validity of this idea on another building suddenly became very important to me. A publication with which I have been very familiar for a long time seemed very suitable for this purpose: “MATKA KATEDRÁLA – chrám sv. Víta, Václava a Vojtěcha” (“MOTHER CATHEDRAL – St. Vitus, Wenceslas and Adalbert Cathedral”) by Ladislav Moučka. The book contains a wealth of perfect drawings, architectural analysis, and reveals the spiritual and compositional principles of historical realities. The proportions are interpreted numerically with their symbolic value, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to my previous knowledge, geomantic data can be read from plans and images if they truthfully depict reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I invited Josef Krause and after half a day of dowsing on this book I was able to start drawing the geomantic foundations of both the rotunda and the entire cathedral of St. Vitus, Wenceslaus and Adalbert. The attached drawings in reduced A4 format are the result of my enthusiastic work over several days. They are proof that, similar to what we showed in the area of the monasteries in Bohemian Český Krumlov, we have also discovered the existence of prehistoric sanctuaries in the area of Prague Castle.
        </p>
        <p>
            The agreement with the construction principles of the Stonehenge sanctuary in England also leads us to the question of the cultural connection of the entire prehistoric Europe.
