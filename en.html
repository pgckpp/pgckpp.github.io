        <h1 id="uvod">INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p>
            In the current coronavirus pandemic, we are experiencing a time suitable for deeper reflection on life and
            the world. In this particular situation, I finally started a project I had been thinking about recently. It
            compiles notes and sketches to write a book about our shared experiences over the last few years, which we
            have had during the geomantic landscape study of the city of Český Krumlov and its surroundings. During
            these years of work we managed to find the keys and inspiring elements that guided the founders of the
            urbanistic concept of this wonderful city and great castle.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a former monument architect, I was also interested in the historical period of the actual founding of the
            city and the choice and design of the urban composition. However, this topic was not one of my work tasks
            and, due to the lack of written documents, it is not an area of interest in contemporary history. The
            historic buildings are here, but there is no tangible inspiration to arrange and orient them in this way.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of the last century there was a chance acquaintance with the modest and smiling landscape
            architect Josef Kraus, who was constantly working with a dowsing rod during a trip to Greece. My first
            encounter with this instrument fascinated me. Then it was the turn of the introduction to geomancy. The next
            few years were characterized by completely different content and took on a whole new dimension. There was no
            rush at all during our investigations. Over time, the individual activities linked together in an unplanned
            manner, depending on what opportunities presented themselves. All the while, however, we had an indefinable
            feeling that we were working under the guidance of higher leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
            During these years, each of the two participants in our small group was guided by their intuition during
            their work. The main source of information was the work of Marko Pogačnik, in particular his book “Škola
            geomancy” (“School of Geomancy”), published by Dobra in 2000. We tried to be guided by the most immediate
            feelings and experiences, but basically started from the knowledge gained by a colleague who mastered the
            work with the spiral dowsing rod. Our work was strongly influenced by a subjective view of the world,
            whereby we often came across surprising historical, urbanistic and religious-spiritual insights. The
            long-term activity, which focused mainly on the area of Český Krumlov and the landscape below the Kleť
            (Schöninger) mountain, deserves to be called artistic work in a team rather than scientific work. Therefore,
            it is very likely that there are people with different opinions who will attack and question our research.
        </p>
        <p>
            The observed territory, with its ley line connections, extends over large distances throughout Europe and
            partly across the entire planet Earth. The periods of time that the dowsing rod has traced extend deep into
            the unknown history of the earth and sometimes into geological times when the earth was formed.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the investigations, we often had the feeling that the earth was communicating with us, that it was
            reacting directly to our activities. We have come to the conclusion that the Earth is a living being with
            its own specific intelligence that far exceeds human intelligence. The Earth also shows us a lot of patience
            and is able to forgive in its own way. At the same time, she is willing to give extensive prophecies if
            properly questioned. This information is apparently in the Akashic Records, which can be read by people with
            a certain degree of personal purity and selflessness.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the geomantic work we constantly had the feeling that we were moving in the realm of the subtle
            beings that Marko Pogačnik describes in the book “Elementární bytosti” (“Elemental Beings”), which was
            published by Dobra a Fontána in 1999.
        </p>
        <p>
            The focus of our interest is to demonstrate that historical urban development was clearly motivated by the
            presence of geomantic qualities of the respective territory. This approach was probably commonly used in the
            historical past, although we do not know what name they had for geomancy. Nowadays, this practice is
            completely missing from the contemporary urban planning of our newly built structures.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the course of our geomantic work we have found that a new territory is very closed when entering. The
            gradual opening will only take place after repeated visits. Communicating with Earth also requires a certain
            form of decency and politeness. The attached text provides us with a deep reflection on the world that I
            mentioned in the first sentence of the introduction: “Eleven conditions for the biophilic cultural
            transition” by Josef Šmajs. These are the considerations that precede his philosophical concept of a
            “Constitution for the Earth” (“Ústava Země”), published in 2015 by PRO Publishing House, Banská Bystrica.
            With this publication I would like to personally advocate for such a constitution. I believe that geomancy
            is also part of this problem.
